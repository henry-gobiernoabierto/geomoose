Reference Map
=============

Description
-----------

An extension providing extension map functionality is included with GeoMOOSE 2.7 and above.  It provides a static reference with a dynamic context box.  It can be minified using a toggle button which displays "+" or "-" depending on the state of the reference map widget.

Adding to Application
---------------------

To enable this extension, add the folowing line to the ``<head>`` section of ``geomoose.html``::

	<script type="text/javascript" src="extensions/ReferenceMap.js"></script>


Configuring the Reference Map
-----------------------------

The reference map in the demo is configured to work with the state of Minnesota in web mercator.

1. Create an image with a known size and bounding box.  How Duck Does this::

	I just sniff images with Firebug and modify the WMS request for the right image size and with the bounding bbox taken from BBOX.


  Example Image name: ``dakota_county.png`` with the size of 100x100 pixels.

2. Override the CSS with that image.

   In either the site's CSS or in a ``<style>`` tag in the ``<head>`` of the .html file, add the following::

     .ReferenceMap {
     	background-image: url(dakota_county.png) !important;
	padding-left: 100px !important;
	padding-right: 100px !important;
     }

3. Configure the extent for the image

   In the mapbook, add a param to configure the extent::

     <param name="reference_extent">minx,miny,maxx,maxy</param>

Other Options
-------------

The reference map can be started as open or closed using the "reference_open" boolean.  To start as open, add the following to the mapbook::

    <param name="reference_open">true</param>
