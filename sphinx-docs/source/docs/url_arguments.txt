URL Startup Arguments
=====================

GeoMOOSE has a number of parameters that can change its startup behavior.

debug
-----

Sets whether GeoMOOSE is in debug mode.  Set this parameter to any non-zero value in order to see additional logging information.  This is really only useful for development and should probably only be used in conjunction with a "_dev.html" file.

extent
------

Sets a different startup extent.  The extent should be formatted as `min-x,min-y,max-x,max-y` in the ground units of the map.  Example::

	geomoose.html?extent=-180,-90,180,90

mapbook
-------

Bypass `php/getmapbook.php`.  By default GeoMOOSE will read the mapbook from the file system using `getmapbook.php`, other installations, especially those needing to serve multiple mapbooks can do so by setting the `mapbook` parameter. Example::

	geomoose.html?mapbook=../mapbooks/wms_only.xml

off
---

Turns off default layers.  Uses GeoMOOSE's path convention. Example::

	geomoose.html?off=parcels/parcels;county/all

on
--

Turns on layers.  This follows the same form as the off parameter but turns layers on.
