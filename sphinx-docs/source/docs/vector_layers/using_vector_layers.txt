Using Vector Layers
===================

Configuring Vector Layers For Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuration of vector layer is covered elsewhere.  This is about how to use them.


1. Turn on the Layer of Interest
--------------------------------

In the catalog, click on the check box to turn on the layer to be viewed or edited.  If this is a layer fed by a server, such as WFS, there may be a small delay while the feature definitions are downloaded and rendered.


2. Activating the Layer
-----------------------

For vector layers to be used, they need to be "activated" by the user.  By default GeoMOOSE uses a small green circular button with a white check-mark embedded within it.  Click on this button.  If using the default styling the background of this layer will be highlighted with a gold gradient. 

3. Using the Layer Tools
------------------------

Once a layer is activated, then the Layer Tools can be used to manipulate that layer.  Layers may or may not support specific tool.  If a tool is not supported by a layer, when selected, it will throw an error with an appropriate alter message.

4. Saving Changes
-----------------

If a layer supports saving changes made to it then use the "Save Changes" menu under the "Layer Tools" menu to save those changes.
