How To Build GeoMOOSE from source
=================================

These instructions apply to the GeoMOOSE 2.6 series. 

You will need to rebuild GeoMOOSE from source if you make any changes
to the core code.  This is because the core code is optimized and minified
using the Dojo build system and the output is placed in the htdocs/build
directory.  geomoose.html is set to use this optimized build because it
allow for much faster application load times than using the raw source.
While developing, you may find it more convenient to use geomoose_dev.html
which bypasses the build system and uses the raw JavaScript sources.

Note: These instructions require you to run the Dojo build system.
For now, this means you will need access to a Linux like command line
(bash) and have Java or OpenJDK installed in your path.  This works
trivially on Linux and OS X, and probably works from within Cygwin
on Windows, but this has not been tested.

The GeoMOOSE documentation is maintained using reStructured text
(http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html) and built into HTML or PDF using
Sphinx.  Thus, to build the GeoMOOSE documentation from source, you 
will also need Sphinx installed (http://sphinx.pocoo.org).

Step 0: Obtain a copy of GeoMOOSE
---------------------------------

In can use whatever method you prefer, check out from svn::

	svn co https://svn.osgeo.org/geomoose/geomoose2/trunk geomoose-trunk

Or extract from a tarball.

Step 1: Extract the libraries in libs
-------------------------------------

From the GeoMOOSE base directory (e.g. ``geomoose-trunk``)::

	cd htdocs/libs
	tar xzf OpenLayers-*.tar.gz
	tar xzf dojo-*.tar.gz
	unzip proj4js-1.0.2.zip

Next, run patch_dojo.sh to setup the Dojo build system for GeoMOOSE.

	./patch_dojo.sh

Step 2: Building GeoMOOSE
-------------------------

Again, from the GeoMOOSE base directory, change directories to where the Dojo
build system lives.  Then, run the build.  This will rebuild the files in htdocs/build.::

	cd htdocs/libs/dojo-1.6.1/util/buildscripts
	./build_geomoose2.sh

Step 3: Building the GeoMOOSE documentation
-------------------------------------------

Again, from the GeoMOOSE base directory, change directories to where the Sphinx 
source lives.  Next, build the source using the supplied Makefile (or make.bat 
on Windows)::

	cd sphinx-docs
	make html
