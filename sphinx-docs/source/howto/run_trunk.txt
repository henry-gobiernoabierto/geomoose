How to Run Trunk
==================================================

Background
---------------------
To stay up to date as GeoMOOSE development happens, you may want to track trunk.  To run the most current GeoMOOSE code you will need to svn checkout or svn export `<http://svn.osgeo.org/geomoose/geomoose2/trunk/>`_.  If reading yesterday's newspaper will suffice, you may want to consider running the nightly builds since it is slightly less effort, see also :ref:`download`.  Everytime you download and run that, you will have yesterday's status.  

How to
---------------------


Windows (MS4W)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Have MS4W (MS4W version 3.0.4+ for GeoMoose 2.6) properly installed on your computer, see also :doc:`install MS4W, </docs/install_ms4w>`
#. Create /ms4w/apps/geomoose2/ if you don't already have it (if you already have it, back it up or delete it)
#. Explore to /ms4w/apps/geomoose2/ and svn checkout http://svn.osgeo.org/geomoose/geomoose2/trunk/.  Also consider svn export.  (Note: you will need an svn client to do that, `TortoiseSVN <http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/>`_ works well on Windows.  Access it by right clicking in a window.)
#. Rename /ms4w/apps/geomoose2/conf/ms4w_local_settings.ini to local_settings.ini
#. If you don't already have /ms4w/httpd.d/httpd_geomoose2_ms4w.conf, copy it from /ms4w/apps/geomoose2/ms4w/httpd.d/
#. If you don't already have /ms4w/Apache/htdocs/geomoose2.pkg.html, copy it from /ms4w/apps/geomoose2/ms4w/Apache/htdocs/
#. Restart apache (/ms4w/apache-restart.bat)
#. Point browser to `<http://localhost/geomoose2/geomoose.html>`_
#. To stay current with trunk: if you did svn checkout, then svn update in /ms4w/apps/geomoose2/  (if you did svn export do it again.)
