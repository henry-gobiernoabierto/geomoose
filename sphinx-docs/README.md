Sphinx Documentation for GeoMoose.

Warning! When releasing a new verison it helps to update config-js.rst,
which contains a list of all the current options available in "config.js".

There is a small script included here that parses that file and
converts it to rst: ./doc_config_js.py > source/developer/config.txt
