All of these tools are used to build the GeoMOOSE packaging.  They may have some use to others and are included in the distribution.

These tools are written in Python because I like Python better than PHP.  A LOT BETTER.

createSprite.py
Combines all of the icons in the images/toolbar and images/catalog folder to produce a single 24-bit PNG stored in htdocs/images/all.png.  I use GIMP to convert the image to a GIF as it has a much better PNG->GIF conversion algorithm than does the Python Imaging Library.

compileCSS.py
This script was used to build composite CSS files to decrease download requirements for geomoose.html
