We have included two PHP libraries used for PDF printing operations: 

FPDF - http://www.fpdf.org/
 The license is available in this package [root]/htdocs/php/fpdf/license.txt
 This license is highly permissive (basically, a free for all) and is not covered
 by the GeoMOOSE license.  This license is not, however, incompatible.  

FPDI - http://www.setasign.de/products/pdf-php-solutions/fpdi/ 
 FPDI is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license and not the geomoose license.

 The Apache 2.0 License can be found here:
  http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

 It allows for the redistribution of this "Work" with the GeoMOOSE code base.
